## Quantitative Evaluation Results

### Average Metrics (5 test samples):

| Model       | PSNR (dB) | SSIM   | Performance |
|-------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **HaveliGAN** | **26.96** | **0.9232** | 🥇 Best Overall |
| EdgeConnect | 16.72     | 0.7968 | 🥈 Second |
| MAT         | 16.69     | 0.7963 | 🥉 Third |
| PartialConv | 10.77     | 0.1570 | ❌ Poor |

### Key Findings:

#### 🏆 **HaveliGAN** (Pre-trained, 200 epochs)
- **Highest PSNR**: 26.96 dB (significantly better)
- **Highest SSIM**: 0.9232 (excellent structural similarity)
- **Advantage**: Extensive training (200 vs 5 epochs)
- **Status**: Clear winner due to training maturity

#### 🥈 **EdgeConnect & MAT** (Tied Performance)
- **Very similar metrics**: 
  - EdgeConnect: 16.72 dB PSNR, 0.7968 SSIM
  - MAT: 16.69 dB PSNR, 0.7963 SSIM
- **Training efficiency**: MAT trains faster (3.21 vs 7.15 minutes)
- **Potential**: Both show promise with longer training

#### ❌ **PartialConv** (Underperforming)
- **Lowest metrics**: 10.77 dB PSNR, 0.1570 SSIM

## Visual Comparison Results

### Generated Comparison Images:
- **5 sample comparisons** saved in `comparison_outputs/`
- Each shows: Damaged input, Mask, Ground truth, and all 4 model outputs
- **Files**: `sample_00_comparison.png` to `sample_04_comparison.png`

### Visual Quality Observations:
1. **HaveliGAN**: Produces most realistic and detailed restorations
2. **EdgeConnect/MAT**: Generate reasonable results with room for improvement
3. **PartialConv**: Shows significant artifacts and poor quality

## Technical Achievements

### Model Compatibility Fixes:
✅ **PartialConv**: Fixed mask channel replication issue  
✅ **EdgeConnect**: Fixed input channel mismatch (4→2 channels)  
✅ **MAT**: Fixed discriminator label size mismatch  
✅ **HaveliGAN**: Successfully loaded epoch 200 checkpoint

### Infrastructure Improvements:
- **Sequential Training**: Avoided memory issues by training models one at a time
- **Unified Inference**: All 4 models working together for comparison
- **Automated Evaluation**: Quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) calculation
- **Visual Comparison**: Automated generation of comparison grids

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **HaveliGAN** is currently the best performing model
2. Continue using the epoch 200 checkpoint for applications

### For Further Development:
1. **Fine-tune hyperparameters** for the 3 newly trained models
2. **Increase training time** to match HaveliGAN's 200 epochs

### Expected Improvements:
- EdgeConnect and MAT could potentially match HaveliGAN with extended training

## Conclusion

The comparison successfully demonstrates that:
1. **HaveliGAN remains the strongest performer** due to extensive training
2. **EdgeConnect and MAT show promise** with similar performance levels
3. **Sequential training approach works well** for memory-limited systems
4. **Infrastructure is ready** for extended training and evaluation

The framework is now ready for production use with HaveliGAN or extended training of the alternative models.
